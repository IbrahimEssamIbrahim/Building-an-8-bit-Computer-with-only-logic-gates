# Building-an-8-bit-Computer-with-only-logic-gates

I recently completed a course in Digital Logic Design, which covered the fundamental concepts necessary for entering the realm of digital design. However, the course primarily focused on the theoretical aspects and the functioning of logical blocks, rather than practical implementation in the real world. This inspired me to undertake a project that would allow me to apply what I had learned to a tangible application.

During my search, I came across the idea of building my own fully functional 8-bit computer with a 128-bit memory. This concept was introduced by Ben Eater, a well-known YouTuber. I perceived it as a challenge and watched his video series, ensuring that I comprehended each concept he discussed. Additionally, I tried to document my progress, as Albert Einstein famously said, "If you can't explain it to yourself, then you don't truly understand it."
It's important to note that this computer I'm building wonâ€™t have the capability to play games or display images. Instead, it will be limited to performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. While these may seem like simple concepts, in my opinion understanding how to design the logic that enables such operations can serves as a foundation for solving more complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable subproblems that a computer can handle efficiently.

Having prior experience working with breadboards, I sought to expand my skill set by learning Proteus 8 Pro, a software tool for simulating circuits and observing their behavior. I designed the entire project in Proteus, which allowed me to experiment with different circuit implementations and combinations without the need to wait for physical components to arrive. Throughout this project, I unknowingly developed the skill of reading datasheets, at least to find the necessary information, which is a critical skill for an Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) engineer.

The steps I followed to accomplish this project included:
* Building the clock circuit based on an N555 timer.
* Understanding and constructing flip flops.
* Exploring the concept of buses and their functionality.
* Studying Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs).
* Gaining knowledge about memory components.
* Creating a multi-digit 7-segment counter.
* Familiarizing myself with EPROMs.
* Exploring Central Processing Units (CPUs).

If you are interested in undertaking this project, I highly recommend you watch Ben Eater's YouTube playlist on this subject.
